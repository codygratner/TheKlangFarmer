## 🏛️ Acronym Taxonomy & Collision Safeguards

To prevent naming collisions across C++ header guards, logging macros (`TKS_LOG`), Git repositories, and documentation, the following three-letter acronyms are permanently reserved:

| Acronym | Product Name | Category | Primary Form Factor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TKS** | **The Klang Suite** | Master Ecosystem / Framework | The entire software, DSP, and tooling umbrella |
| **TKF** | **The Klang Farmer** | Flagship Instrument | VST3 / AU / Standalone Audio Plugin |
| **TKP** | **The Klang Planter** | Performance Synthesizer | VST3 / AU / Standalone Audio Plugin |
| **TKE** | **The Klang Editor** | Developer & Modder Deck | Standalone JUCE Application |
| **TKM** | **The Klang Mill** | Multi-Effects Playground | VST3 / AU Audio Plugin |
| **TKR** | **The Klang R1 (TKR-1)** | 7-Voice Rhythm Synthesizer | VST3 / AU / Standalone Audio Plugin |
| **TKB** | **The Klang Box** | Embedded Hardware Platform | Dedicated Microcontroller Desktop / Eurorack Hardware |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TKS vs. TKB Convention**:  
> `TKS` is reserved exclusively for **The Klang Suite** (framework code, `TKS_LOG`, system architecture).  
> All embedded microcontroller hardware offerings use **`TKB`** (**The Klang Box**), with hardware variant designations (e.g. `TKB-Daisy`, `TKB-8`).

## 🛠️ Foundational Ecosystem & Infrastructure

Behind the musician-facing instruments lies the architectural infrastructure that powers the suite:

1. **The Klang Boilerplate**:
   - Modern C++20 / JUCE 9 open-source plugin starter template repository.
   - Packages the zero-allocation DSP core, `TbdAudio::FastMath`, JSON-driven APVTS parameter schemas, and the headless `gui_tests` reflection suite for the open-source audio developer community.
2. **The Klang Vault**:
   - Private Obsidian Second Brain and Asymmetric Sync Bridge (`tools/sync_obsidian_vault.ps1`).
   - Enables conflict-free mobile note capture via Obsidian Sync, offline documentation reading, and live build/error telemetry reporting.

## 🚨 Product Identity Drift Guardrail (The "Stay in Your Lane" Policy)

To preserve the focus and punch of each offering, **New Klang City (Planning Headquarters)** is officially chartered to monitor incoming ideas, `/plan` drafts, and `/grill-me` interviews for **scope drift**.

Whenever a proposed feature threatens to blur a product's core identity, the agent will flag it:

| Product | The Core Trap (Scope Drift) | The Guardrail Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TKF** *(Farmer)* | **Dumbing it down**: Stripping out modular modulation, operator routing, or parameter depth to make it "easy". | *Flag*: "Farmer is the flagship sound-design laboratory. Keep the depth; if you want rapid sweet-spots, route this idea to Planter!" |
| **TKP** *(Planter)* | **Feature creep & menu bloat**: Adding multi-page tabs, deep sub-menus, or multi-slot FX racks. | *Flag*: "Planter is the lean & mean BIA machine. Keep it single-surface and immediate. If it needs 8 pages, it belongs in Farmer!" |
| **TKM** *(Mill)* | **Identity confusion**: Adding synth oscillators, MIDI note playback, or complex modulation matrices. | *Flag*: "Mill is a pure multi-effects rack (Soundtoys style). It processes external audio; it does not generate notes." |
| **TKR** *(R1)* | **Tab & complexity clutter**: Adding tabs, sample layering, or micro-editing menus that break live finger drumming. | *Flag*: "R1 is an ER-1 tribute console. All 7 voice strips must stay on one screen with octave-invariant white-key triggers." |
| **TKB** *(The Klang Box)* | **Embedded unfriendliness**: Allocating heap memory, exceeding microcontroller SRAM/Flash budgets, or confusing acronyms (`TKS`). | *Flag*: "TKB is dedicated bare-metal hardware. Keep DSP zero-allocation, enforce hardware budgets, and protect the `TKB` designation." |
| **TKE** *(Editor)* | **Engine bloat**: Adding audio playback, recording, or turning the developer deck into a mini-DAW. | *Flag*: "The Klang Editor is an offline declarative data, curve, and theme inspector. Keep it lean and decoupled from DAW runtimes." |
